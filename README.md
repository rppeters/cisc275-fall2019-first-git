1. Create java files to make this code compile and run.

2. What five objects are created in the main?
	an ArrayList casted to Dogs
	3 Dog isntances
	1 Comparator instance used for comparing Animals

3. Can you spot the Comparator constructor call? Where is the class definition for the Comparator?
	the constructor call is in Line 16 in the Collections.sort() call where it is passed in as an argument so that
	it is only used locally in that function call
